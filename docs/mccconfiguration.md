# MCC Configuration
## Overview

This section details the MPLAB Code Configurator (MCC) setup for the subsystem,  
including I²C communication, GPIO pin assignments, and peripheral configurations.  

It outlines how the PIC18F47Q10 microcontroller is set as the I²C Master  
to communicate with the distance sensors and how debugging LEDs  
are configured as digital outputs.
