## Block Diagram of Subsystem: Distance Sensor

This is the block diagram for our distance sensor subsystem. The sensor will wait for user input from the external OLED subsytem by Xander Heafey. Once the user input is received, the distance sensor will be in the "on" state. Distastance data will be collected and transmitted to the external Motor Driver Subsystem by Sara Bohart to initiate motor rotations at speeds which correlate with the collected distance data.
