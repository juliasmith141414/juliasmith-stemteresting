# Power Budget
## Overview

The power budget page outlines the estimated power consumption for each component 
in my subsystem for this project, ensuring that my power supply can reliably support the system. 

It details the voltage and current requirements for the microcontroller, sensors, 
voltage regulator, and debugging LEDs. 

This analysis helps optimize battery life, prevent overloading, and ensure stable 
operation under all conditions.
